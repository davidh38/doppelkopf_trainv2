*   GUI should have no logic at all except for showing, no special routes, everything depends on the game state
*   New features will be implemented by pull requests
*   Unit tests will test the game like in the last game
*   The reuse of the old versions code should be done
*   More functional
*   Data will be the first citizen and the most important

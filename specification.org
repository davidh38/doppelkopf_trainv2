** Data Structures
   - The following immutable data structures will be created:
     - game
     - player
     - table
   - A table can play one or more games
   - 4 players are needed to play a game
   - A player may be of type human or AI
   - The user gets a random UUID, which is sent with every request to identify the user
   - The server keeps track of all players and tables of the server

** Frontend
   - In order to have a more seamless user experience, we will add Socket.IO.
   - There will be 3 main windows:
     - Lobby for game joining and creation
     - The gameplay itself
     - Game summary
   - For identification, JavaScript code will post a UUID with every request.

** Testing
   - For a testing mode, the players can play random but legible cards to a certain point. This can be reproduced.
   - Also, game states should be saved and be able to be started with.
   - For example, a game can be simulated to have run 4 times to the fifth trick. This data structure: user should then be able to connect to the game with the right identification.
